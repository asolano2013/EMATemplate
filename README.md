# Create an Intel® Endpoint Management Assistant (Intel® EMA) instance, part of the Intel vPro® platform.

This template will create a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure. It will automatically deploy all requirements needed in order to get Intel EMA configured.

The D-series Azure Virtual Machines offer a combination of vCPUs, memory, and temporary storage able to meet the requirements associated with most production workloads.

The D v3 virtual machines are hyper-threaded general-purpose VMs based on the 2.3 GHz Intel® XEON ® E5-2673 v4 (Broadwell) processor. They can achieve 3.5 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0.
